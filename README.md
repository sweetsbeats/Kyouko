# Kyouko
Kyouko is a small, general purpose Discord bot written in discord.js

Kyouko Is currently expanding every day, focusing on staying small and robust in it's job.
Currently, she touts detailed interaction reports and optional logging to file, and in the future will have a detailed console command interactions, giving the user access to change settings at runtime, and puppet controls(talking from the bot, ect.)

Future features are currently implemented on whim, however with the general vision of providing use to the communities around me in various ways.
