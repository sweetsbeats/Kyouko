# Kyouko
Kyouko is a small, general purpose Discord bot written in discord.js

Kyouko was originally supposed to be written in C++, however after struggling to make the Sleepy Discord library work with 
VS2017 (something to do with curl and SSL) I got frustrated, and moved onto repurposing the code from Lambda-bot, however to 
my dismay, the discordgo library must have broken, as no matter how many times I gave it my token, my bot wouldn't go online.
Eventually, I caved and moved to discord.js to get the job done. I'm not proud, but what's done is done.
